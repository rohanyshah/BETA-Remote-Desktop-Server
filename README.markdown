RDServer
========

RDServer is an experimental Objective-C/Cocoa remote desktop server for OS X. RDServer was designed using modern technologies and requires Mac OS X 10.7 or greater to run. Right now it's not very useful, as its corresponding client application (RDClient) hasn't been released.

**Development status: about 50% implemented**
